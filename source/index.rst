Welcome to Agromicrobiome's documentation!
=================================================

MicroAgrobiome gathers metagenomes collected from agriculturally relevant plants.

We processed these samples to obtain taxonomic and functional information about the plant-associated microbiome in a standardized way.

MicroAgrobiome will facilitate the standardized deposition and retrieval of agriculturally relevant microbiomes, providing a baseline of microorganism content in crops and empowering the development of bioinformatics tools related to agriculture-relevant microorganisms. Furthermore, we provide a tool for constructing co-occurrence networks from biom files.

All scripts and code are available on `Github <https://github.com/nselem/microagrobioma>`_. All content, including OTU and functional tables and MAGs, is available for download.

The CONAHCYT 320237 project funded this application.
