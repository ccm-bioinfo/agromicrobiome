## Search Examples

### By MAG

Follow these steps to explore **Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs)**:

1. **Select "MAG"** as the sample type.  
2. **Choose a plant** (e.g., *Soya bean*) from the dropdown.  
3. Click **Consult** to view results.

### By Metagenome

Follow these steps to explore **Metagenome**:

1. **Select "Metagenome"** as the sample type.  
2. **Choose a plant** (e.g., *Sunflower*) from the dropdown.  
3. Click **Consult** to view results.
